# Secrets & Credentials Setup

These files are excluded from git (see .gitignore) because this is a public repo.
You must create them manually on any new machine you develop on.

## Files you need to create locally (never commit these)

### 1. `app/android/app/google-services.json`
Downloaded from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Android app.
Required for Firebase to work on Android.

### 2. `app/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
Downloaded from Firebase Console → Project Settings → iOS app.
Required when iOS development begins.

### 3. `app/android/key.properties`
Your Android signing key config. Created when you generate a release keystore.
Format:
```
storePassword=your_password
keyPassword=your_password
keyAlias=your_alias
storeFile=path/to/your.keystore
```

### 4. `app/lib/firebase_options.dart`
Auto-generated by the FlutterFire CLI when you configure Firebase.
Run: `flutterfire configure`

## IMPORTANT: Back up your keystore file

The `.jks` / `.keystore` file is your Android app signing key.
- Store it somewhere safe (external drive, encrypted cloud storage)
- If you lose it, you CANNOT publish updates to your existing app on Play Store
- You would have to publish as a brand new app and lose all existing users

## Where to store secrets safely
- Use a password manager (Bitwarden — free, open source)
- Or an encrypted folder on your personal drive
- Never in WhatsApp, email, or plain text notes
